# Time-Domain-and-frequency-Domain-representation-using-Python



# The Python Control Systems Library (control) 
provides common functions for analyzing and designing feedback control systems.
# SOME KEY FEATURES ARE:

Linear input/output systems in state-space and frequency domain

Block diagram algebra: serial, parallel, and feedback interconnections

Time response: initial, step, impulse

Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots

Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins

Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator

Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)
